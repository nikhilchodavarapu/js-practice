### Is string ends with substring ?

Write a function that tells if a string ends with a specific substring

Examples:
  endsWith('hello world', 'ld') => true
  endsWith('hello world', 'wor') => false
  endsWith('hello world', 'hello') => false

**Your function must return a value**

It's not necessary to print the result on screen, 
however to test your function you are free to print the result.

> Check whether character in string from startIndex is equal to character in substring.
> If characters are until equal until end then return true else false.
